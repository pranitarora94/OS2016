All Code is in C++. All output is in standard output (printed using cout). Filename should include path if not in same directory.

With makefile:
	Run the commands:
	1) make
	2) ./out filename

	where filename is the nameof the input file to be processed. 

Without makefile:
	Run the commands:
	1) g++ HW1.cpp -o out
	2) ./out filename

Example of running the executable: 
./out "/home/pa1230/Documents/OS/labsamples/input-1"
